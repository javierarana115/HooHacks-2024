# Eco Awareness

## For HooHacks 2024 🍃

A website that provides the public with information about environmental sustainability and promotes understanding and care for the environment, with a bit of web-scrapping capabilities.

We love the outdoors, and the health of the environment is our utmost priority.  The health of the environment affects our daily lives in huge ways and ultimately dictates the health of all living things, especially us.  We aim to promote and spread even greater awareness of the beauty and necessity of sustainability.  After all, if the environment won't be able to sustain itself, how will we ever be able to sustain ourselves?
